This Java Quiz Game begins by creating an array of questions and a two-dimensional array of options, where each question has four multiple-choice answers. Another array, answers, stores the correct option number for each corresponding question. A score variable is initialized to keep track of correct answers, and a Scanner object is created to read user input. The game starts by printing a welcome message, and then the program enters a for loop that runs once for every question in the quiz. Inside the loop, the current question is displayed, followed by its four options. The user is then asked to enter their guess as a number (1–4). The input is compared with the correct answer stored in the answers array; if they match, a “CORRECT” message is displayed and the score increases by one. If the answer is wrong, the program displays “WRONG” and continues to the next question. After all questions have been answered, the program prints the user’s final score out of the total number of questions. Finally, the Scanner is closed. Overall, this program demonstrates how to use arrays, loops, user input, and conditional logic to create a simple interactive quiz game in Java.
